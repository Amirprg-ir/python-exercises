# Title: Simple Calculator with If-Elif-Else - While Loop
# Description:
#   This script implements a simple interactive calculator
#   using a while loop and if-elif-else conditions.
#   The user is presented with a menu to choose an operation:
#     [1] Addition
#     [2] Subtraction
#     [3] Multiplication
#     [4] Division
#     [q] Quit
#   After selecting an operation, the user is asked to input
#   two numbers, and the result is calculated and displayed.
#   The program continues to show the menu until the user
#   chooses to quit by entering 'q'.
